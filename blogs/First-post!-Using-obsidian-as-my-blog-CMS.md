Hello all! I finally have enough motivation to creating my own portfolio website.
I'll use this blog as a place to practice my writing skills and improve my English. Since I'm not a native English speaker.

For this first post, I'll explaining how I use Obsidian as my blogs CMS.

## Why obsidian?
For the past year, I have been using couple of different note-taking apps such as **Notion**, **ClickUp**, **OneNote**, and **Obsidian**. I even tried to create my own note-taking apps for my Study Independent assignment called [Notekake](https://github.com/mbahArip/mini-project-notokake), but I don't have enough motivation to improving it.

At first, I want to use **Notion** since there already a library called `react-notion-x` but i don't like block based editing that **Notion** use, so i decide i will use **Obsidian** instead.
